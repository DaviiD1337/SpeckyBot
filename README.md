# How to successfully run your own instance of the bot?

- Create a Discord Bot account.
- Download or clone this repository
- Extract the files
- Download all NPM dependencies [npm i]
- Run the .bat file and close it once you get an error
- Enter the private informations in the config.json file (bot token, prefix, etc.)
- Run the .bat file once again and you should be done!

# External dependencies

- For the music features, you should have FFMPEG already installed on your machine (not the NPM version)
